[00:26.56] See, sometimes it's rainy
[00:32.13] Sometimes it's cloudy
[00:35.26] That's what journey means
[00:38.42] Can't see, the scene ahead's blurry
[00:44.65] But we still must pursue the dream
[01:01.65] 
[00:51.45] Travel through the heights and shallows
[00:54.78] Put on a sturdy shell to face the hard perils
[00:57.57] I hear about your last trace
[01:03.86] Love is shining bright in the deep night
[01:06.98] Stand up to fight many times
[01:08.16] Then know what's wrong and right
[01:09.82] The scars will finally heal
[01:23.32] 
[01:15.61] Do not fear the road not taken, the unresolved problem
[01:22.25] Do not go, gentle in that good night
[01:28.04] The day I wanna seize comes with the greetings of the breeze
[01:34.38] Will there be that day? Please tell me, tell me
[01:57.88] 
[02:06.15] Travel through infinite dusks and dawns
[02:09.09] Break through the strong tide to reach the other side
[02:12.02] I hear about your last trace
[02:18.48] Some words are heavy when some words are light
[02:21.53] We are like two meteors that miss each other
[02:24.48] We'll finally reunite
[02:34.98] 
[02:29.95] To catch up with the sunlight, with the brightest fire
[02:36.73] The memories softly touch my face
[02:42.57] The freedom I wanna seize takes me to an unknown place
[02:48.77] At the journey's end, we will meet
[03:05.77] 
[02:54.85] To catch up with the sunlight, with the brightest fire
[03:01.66] Because of you, the story will go on
[03:07.36] The quest along the way, we will always appreciate (yeah)
[03:13.65] At the journey's end, we will meet, we will meet again (yeah)
