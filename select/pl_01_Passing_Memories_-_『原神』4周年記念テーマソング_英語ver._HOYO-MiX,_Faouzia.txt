See, sometimes it's rainy
Sometimes it's cloudy
That's what journey means
Can't see,
the scene ahead's blurry
But we still must
pursue the dream
Travel through the
heights and shallows
Put on a sturdy shell
to face the hard perils
I hear about your last trace
Love is shining bright
in the deep night
Stand up to fight many times
Then know what's wrong and right
The scars will finally heal
Do not fear the road not taken,
the unresolved problem
Do not go,
gentle in that good night
The day I wanna seize comes
with the greetings of the breeze
Will there be that day?
Please tell me, tell me
Travel through infinite
dusks and dawns
Break through the strong tide
to reach the other side
I hear about your last trace
Some words are heavy
when some words are light
We are like two
meteors that miss each other
We'll finally reunite
To catch up with the sunlight,
with the brightest fire
The memories softly
touch my face
The freedom I wanna seize takes
me to an unknown place
At the journey's end,
we will meet
To catch up with the sunlight,
with the brightest fire
Because of you,
the story will go on
The quest along the way,
we will always appreciate (yeah)
At the journey's end,
we will meet, we will meet again
(yeah)
